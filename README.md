Harsha Krishna Divate — Portfolio Website

This repository contains the code for my personal academic portfolio.
I built this website mainly for my Erasmus Mundus 2026 applications and to have a clean place to showcase my work, projects, and background.

Live site: https://harshadivate.github.io/portfolio/

About the Project

This is a simple static website built using:

HTML

CSS

JavaScript

The layout follows a bento-style grid, and the background uses a small canvas animation I wrote for some visual depth.
Everything runs client-side and doesn’t require any frameworks or build tools.

What the Portfolio Includes

Brief intro and academic summary

My Erasmus-aligned research areas

A few selected projects

Technical skills and certifications

Awards from hackathons and events

The goal was to keep it clean, fast, and easy to read for reviewers.

Project Structure
index.html    → main webpage
style.css     → styling and responsive layout
main.js       → background animation + email copy function

Deployment

Any changes pushed to the main branch update the live site automatically.
